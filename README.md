# 16-bit RISC CPU
---
## Abstract:
This project presents the design and implementation of a 16-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) processor using the Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). The processor architecture consists of essential components, including the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Register File, Control Unit, and Memory. The design was deployed on a Xilinx Basys 3 FPGA board to validate functionality. The proposed CPU is capable of fetching, decoding, and executing a set of 16-bit instructions. Experimental results demonstrate correct execution of arithmetic, logical, and control instructions, confirming the effectiveness of the design. This work provides a practical foundation for understanding computer architecture and can be extended for educational purposes or as a baseline for more advanced processors.
